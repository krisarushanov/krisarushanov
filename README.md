### NO FRILLS JUST THRILLSâœ¨

Results-driven web developer who transforms how users interact with data. I earned a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the University of Washington Coding Boot Camp. I enjoy making the most out of users experiences by experimenting, staying curious and innovative thinking. 
Strengths in communication, teamwork, experimentation and building projects from ideation to execution. Passion for all things web with a curiosity to learn and willingness to do things the right way.
Lets connect! I'm always working on a fun project on Github or building my network on LinkedIn. 
You can also find me getting washed up trying to surf. Do something awesome and don't forget the best surfer is the one having the most fun.
